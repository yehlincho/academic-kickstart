abstract: In this article, we demonstrate fluorescent signal amplification via cyclic staining of target molecules (FRACTAL), a technique that can amplify the signal intensity of immunofluorescence staining more than nine-fold via simple cyclic staining of secondary antibodies. We also show that FRACTAL is compatible with four-color imaging and expansion microscopy imaging..
